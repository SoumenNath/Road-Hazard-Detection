A detect_and_log.py that saves detections to CSV

A dashboard or report builder?


Feature	Why It’s Useful
TTS Audio Alerts (e.g., “Debris ahead”)	Makes it accessible or hands-free
Web Interface (Streamlit/Gradio)	Great for demos
Frame skipping (faster processing)	Improve speed on longer videos
Model confidence thresholding	Filter out low-confidence predictions

Annotate 200–300+ images for better accuracy

Train with augmentations (YOLOv8 does this automatically, but you can tweak it)

Try larger model (yolov8s.pt, m.pt) if you get access to GPU

Add more hazard classes (e.g., pedestrians, animals, vehicles blocking path)
