A detect_and_log.py that saves detections to CSV

A dashboard or report builder


TTS Audio Alerts (e.g., “Debris ahead”)	Makes it accessible or hands-free
Web Interface (Streamlit/Gradio)	Great for demos
Frame skipping (faster processing)	Improve speed on longer videos
Model confidence thresholding	Filter out low-confidence predictions

Annotate 200–300+ images for better accuracy

Train with augmentations (YOLOv8 does this automatically, but you can tweak it)

Try larger model (yolov8s.pt, m.pt) if you get access to GPU

Add more hazard classes (e.g., pedestrians, animals, vehicles blocking path)

Exporting your model for mobile

Organizing your project repo

Naming conventions or model versioning


 Highly Recommended Next Steps
A. Save detection logs for analysis
🔹 A version that logs to JSON instead? A summary report generator (e.g., hazard counts per class)? A dashboard interface to visualize this log? Let’s build the analysis layer on top!
B. Add hazard summaries per video
🔹 Add a matplotlib bar chart visualization? Generate separate logs or summaries per video file? Turn this into a Jupyter Notebook dashboard?
C. Add visual alert overlays
🔹 Post the fully updated detect_and_log.py with this alert overlay? 🔔 Add sound alert (requires playsound or pygame) 🖼️ Customize appearance (e.g. icons, animated alerts, danger symbols) 📱 Prepare for real-time deployment (OpenCV window, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
D. GUI (WEB)
🔹 A progress bar or spinner Customizable confidence threshold or batch size Real-time preview of video Hazard filtering (e.g., only "pothole")
